Juanita's journey in the forrest of Orangina starts, 
having to watch her step of gigantic spiderfeces while she makes her way through the forrest. While she was halfway in the forest, she was attacked by a flying fish, the fish was wielding a 10 meter bow and shot a couple arrows towards Juanita. The arrows however, didn't do anything to her, as Juanita was a 25 meter long giant, with skin as hard as steel.
