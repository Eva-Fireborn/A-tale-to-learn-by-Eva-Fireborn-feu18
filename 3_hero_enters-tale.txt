Our hero, a huge happy giant, named Juanita, extremly allergic to oranges, which was very problematic, because of what the circumstances were.
Mighty orangeman with the power of citrus fruits was for now just a sidekick, but hoped to be more ripe in the future so he could turn in to another might hero.
Juanita always carried her notebook of powers!
