Juanita realizes that the spiders web is made of yarn. She asks the spider why it doesn't make it's own webb? She knows it's possible, she read it in her notebook.
The spider is perplexed, can it do that? Spiders have used yarn for so long that they had forgotten how to make their own.
They're now forced to work for yarn.
Juanita and her hamster Jerry helps the spider to make her own webb and the spider is ever grateful to her and Jerry the hamster.
